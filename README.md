Remake of the popular board game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) that utilizes speech for all interactions between the player and the computer opponent.

# Controls
For controlling the program you must use the following speech commands:
- When placing your ships, indicate where your tip of your ship will be located (i.e. "A4") as well as the orientation of your ship (i.e. "horizontal")
- When it is your turn, call out the tile you'd like to fire at on the opponent's board by saying the corresponding letter and number coordinates (i.e. "C3")

## Dependencies
- Python v. 3.6.0
- SpeechRecognition v. 3.8.1
  - PyAudio v. 0.2.11
- PyGame v. 1.9.6
- [tts](https://github.com/DeepHorizons/tts) v. 0.1
